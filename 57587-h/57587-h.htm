<p>The Elves are the dearest and most
mischievous little people in all the wide
world.</p>

<p>They live in Elfland, and Elfland can
be found in every corner of the globe.
They take up their abode on wooded hillsides,
beside murmuring streams, or in
deep, leafy forests. In the dead of night,
when all the world is still, they steal forth
from their dwellings and start on their
merry midnight rounds. They dance in
the moonlight on soft dewy lawns under
wide-spreading trees. They visit their
neighbors and friends among elves, and
their neighbors and friends among men.</p>

<p>The Elves can see and not be seen; they
can hear and not be heard; and are so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
light and nimble in their movements that
they can float through the air like a leaf
in the wind.</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a company
of Elves that lived in a stone wall. They
had left their home in the forest glade for
a season in the <i>Giant World</i>, as they
called our world&mdash;because it seemed so
big to them.</p>

<p>While they were wandering about in
search of a place to settle, they came upon
a hole in a stone wall that exactly suited
them, it was so snug and comfortable.
The Elves were very much delighted and
at once decided to make their home there.</p>

<p>The wall belonged to Dr. Templeton.
He liked privacy, and so he had this high
stone wall built all around his garden and
grounds.</p>

<p>But Dr. Templeton&#8217;s gardener was very
lazy and careless, and when some stones
fell out of the wall, he simply rolled them
over the bank. That was easier, he
thought, than mending the wall; and,
besides, the wall was so very thick that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
a few stones more or less did not matter
in the least.</p>

<p>The Elves thought it was very fortunate
for them that the gardener was so
lazy and careless, and promised themselves
a gay good time with a season in
the Giant World.</p>

<p>The members of this company of Elves
were:</p>

<p><i>Captain Featherweight</i>, the head of the
company.</p>

<p><i>Rainbow</i>, master of ceremonies.</p>

<p><i>Rhymo</i>, the poet-elf.</p>

<p><i>Tono</i>, the music-elf.</p>

<p><i>Lightning</i>, the messenger-elf.</p>

<p><i>Iris-Wing</i>, the flower-elf.</p>

<p><i>Touchstone</i>, the jester.</p>

<p><i>Owly</i>, the wise one.</p>

<p><i>Slumber</i>, the dream-elf.</p>

<p>After the Elves had made a tour of all
the grounds around Templeton Hall, their
Captain called them together to decide
upon a name for their new home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us call our new home &#8216;Scale-Cliff&#8217;,&#8221;
said Tono, the music-elf.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>&#8220;A very pretty idea,&#8221; said Rainbow,
&#8220;but don&#8217;t you think &#8216;Rocklight&#8217; would
be prettier still?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Rocklight&#8217; won&#8217;t do at all,&#8221; said
Slumber, the dream-elf, &#8220;because it suggests
wakefulness&mdash;so I propose that we
call it &#8216;Slumber-Nest&#8217; instead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you think of anything but
dreams and slumber?&#8221; asked Iris-Wing,
the flower-elf. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t live in a place
with a name like &#8216;Slumber-Nest&#8217;, and so
I move that we call our new home &#8216;Rose-Bower.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! pooh!&#8221; said Owly, the wise one,
&#8220;&#8216;Rose-Bower&#8217; suggests a garden, and a
garden isn&#8217;t a house, so I think you&#8217;ll all
agree with me that &#8216;Stone-Wall-Gap&#8217; is
much more appropriate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t agree, Owly,&#8221; said several
of the Elves at once.</p>

<p>But here Captain Featherweight called
the meeting to order, and ended all dispute
by declaring that the name of the
new home should be &#8220;Mount Fern&#8221;, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
there was a fern growing just below,
at the foot of the wall.</p>

<p>As a rule, the Elves lived in peace and
harmony, and they adored their Captain.
His word was law, and when any disputes
arose he always acted as judge.</p>

<p>After the name of the new home had
been decided upon, Captain Featherweight
gave each elf his work to do in its
arrangement and furnishing, and in a
very short time it was all in perfect order
and ready to live in.</p>

<p>The Captain was very much pleased,
and complimented his Elves on their ability
to do their work well and quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And since our house is now all in perfect
order,&#8221; said the Captain, &#8220;let us have
some music to celebrate the event. Tono,
will you please sing something for us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With pleasure,&#8221; answered Tono.
&#8220;What would you like?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I leave the selection entirely to you,&#8221;
said the Captain.</p>

<p>Then Tono, who was leader of the elfin
choir, played and sang:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Twinkle, twinkle, firefly bright,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Through the dark and cloudy night,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Floating gaily in the air,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Here and there, and ev&#8217;rywhere.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;How your cheerful little gleam,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Joyful makes the darkness seem,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Where you flit no elf is sad,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Twinkle, twinkle, firefly glad.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why you should sing that
now,&#8221; said Owly. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t the least bit
appropriate; the fireflies are not twinkling
and won&#8217;t be for some time to come
if we can judge by the look of the sky.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that just like Owly?&#8221; said Slumber.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are always so literal, Owly,&#8221; said
Rhymo. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know that fact
hasn&#8217;t half as much to do with music and
poetry as fancy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the same,&#8221; said Owly, &#8220;I think
&#8216;Our New Home&#8217; would have been much
more appropriate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t you be more agreeable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Owly?&#8221; asked the flower-elf. &#8220;Anything
is appropriate when you&#8217;re happy, and
besides, Captain Featherweight left the
choosing to Tono, and why shouldn&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The music was beautiful,&#8221; said Captain
Featherweight. &#8220;I always love to
hear about the gay little fireflies. But
look at the pink in the east! That means
that the King of Day is coming over the
hills in his chariot. To rest! To rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the Elves of Mount Fern lay down
on their soft little beds of leaves and moss,
and slumbered till starlight again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Elves always begin their <i>day</i> in the
evening instead of the morning, so that
what is early for them is late for us, and
what is early for us is late for them.</p>

<p>Every evening as soon as the stars
peeped out of the sky, Captain Featherweight
always gave the command:
&#8220;Right! Left! Shoulder arms!&#8221; This
simply meant, &#8220;Get to work,&#8221; and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the signal for every elf to be about his
business.</p>

<p>All night long the gay little Elves were
as busy as bees, but no matter where they
were or what they were doing, they always
came back to Mount Fern before sunrise,
and rested till starlight again.</p>

<p>The next evening Captain Featherweight
gave his usual command and every
elf began to work.</p>

<p>Iris-Wing, the flower-elf, scampered
lightly down the fern ladder and went
about his business in the garden. Although
all the Elves loved the flowers, he
was the one who took most care of them,
and so the other Elves called him &#8220;Iris-Wing,
the flower-elf.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he wandered about from flower to
flower he whispered to each a word of
good cheer. The tulips and daisies were
all fast asleep and heard not a word that
he said, but the roses were as wide-awake
as in broad daylight, and they bowed to
the flower-elf and said: &#8220;We&#8217;re watching
the Queen of Night climbing over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
tall stone chimneys of Templeton Hall.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the roses were watching the moon,
the flower-elf went on, and was just going
to speak to the foxgloves when he heard
two monster voices from the Giant World.</p>

<p>And he listened, for he couldn&#8217;t help
listening, the voices were so loud and
harsh; or so it seemed to him, although we
would call them very sweet voices.</p>

<p>It was Mary and Anna Templeton, the
Doctor&#8217;s daughters, who were talking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mary,&#8221; said Anna, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got an idea.
I want to make a mattress and pillows for
Emily&#8217;s doll, and some of the bird-houses
are just bursting with feathers. Let us
fill the mattress and pillows with feathers
from the bluebirds&#8217; house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that will be perfectly lovely!&#8221; said
Mary.</p>

<p>&#8220;And let us have them ready for her
birthday,&#8221; continued Anna, &#8220;and we&#8217;ll
send a verse from the bluebirds something
like this:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Dear Emily:</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Our feathers free,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Without a fee,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; We all agree</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; To send to thee!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t that be fun?&#8221; laughed Mary,
&#8220;but who&#8217;ll get the feathers for us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get them myself,&#8221; replied Anna.
&#8220;With a long stepladder I can easily reach
the bluebirds&#8217; house. This evening we&#8217;ll
make the cases, and then tomorrow afternoon
right after school we&#8217;ll get the
feathers.&#8221;</p>

<p>The flower-elf, who was getting more
and more provoked every moment, could
stand the conversation no longer, and flew
swiftly back to Mount Fern in search of
the dream-elf, to whom he repeated every
word he had heard in the garden.</p>

<p>The dream-elf was very indignant at
the thought of the bluebirds&#8217; house being
robbed of its feathers by these monsters
of the Giant World, and he said to the
flower-elf: &#8220;She shall <i>not</i> rob the bluebirds&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
house, for I&#8217;ll beat on the drum of
her ear and make her dream a horrible
dream!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You surely will?&#8221; urged the flower-elf.</p>

<p>&#8220;Without fail,&#8221; replied Slumber.</p>

<p>The flower-elf rubbed his hands and
laughed gleefully, and then ran back to
his work in the garden.</p>

<p>He spoke to the tall, pink foxgloves and
told them that foxgloves were favorites of
fairies all over the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are very proud to hear <i>you</i> say
so,&#8221; replied the Foxgloves, &#8220;for everyone
knows that fairies or elves are the favorites
of children all over the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the flower-elf bowed low, and
passed on to the snapdragons, and asked
them how <i>they</i> did.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re impatient,&#8221; said they, &#8220;and can
hardly wait for the morning. We don&#8217;t
see why there should be any night when
the day is so much finer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I really cannot agree with you,&#8221; said
Iris-Wing, &#8220;for we Elves love starlight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and moonlight much better than sunlight,
and so do some flowers, some birds, and
some insects.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but more flowers, more birds, and
more insects love day than love night.
We&#8217;ve really no patience with people who
don&#8217;t love the sun. Of all living creatures
we think the bee is the best, and she loves
the sun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, if you&#8217;re done,&#8221; said the
flower-elf, &#8220;I think I shall run, for there&#8217;s
work to be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he had finished his work in the
garden, Iris-Wing called at the bluebirds&#8217;
house to tell him that hawks were abroad
in the land. &#8220;And they&#8217;re <i>human</i>,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;but fear not, we&#8217;ll protect you.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At twelve o&#8217;clock that very night, the
dream-elf flew through Anna&#8217;s open window,
and beat on the drum of her ear.
And she dreamed, and dreamed, and
dreamed. She dreamed she was in a
strange and far-off land where the air was
filled with birds, and there was such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
commotion that it deafened her. She
couldn&#8217;t believe there were so many birds
in all the world, and some of them were
so large and fierce that they terrified her.</p>

<p>At last she saw some bluebirds coming
toward her; and they grew, and grew, and
grew, until at last they were as big as
cormorants. Then they threatened her
with their beaks and screamed at her:</p>

<p>&#8220;You would take our feathers, would
you? Flint-hearted girl! Cruel! Cruel!
Cruel!&#8221;</p>

<p>But here General Grosbeak appeared
on the scene, and commanded the chattering
to cease.</p>

<p>&#8220;This case,&#8221; said he, &#8220;must be tried by
King Crest and his Council.&#8221;</p>

<p>King Crest, as you must know, was
King of Birdland, and he and his Council
settled the affairs of his Kingdom.</p>

<p>So King Crest and his Council called a
meeting to decide what should be done if
the bluebirds&#8217; feathers were stolen, and
after a long and angry debate it was decided
that, in such an event, birds of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
kinds should in future avoid the grounds
around Templeton Hall, and that those
who were already there should vacate
their dwellings.</p>

<p>&#8220;I move an amendment,&#8221; said Colonel
Claw. &#8220;I move that Screech-owls and
English sparrows annoy the Doctor&#8217;s
family as much as possible, especially
Anna.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel Claw, you&#8217;ll be promoted,&#8221;
said the King. &#8220;A very good idea! All
in favor of this amendment lift the right
claw.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this, every bird lifted the right claw,
and the motion was carried.</p>

<p>When the Council adjourned, all the
birds passed Anna in single file, and each,
as he passed her, pecked her on the arm
or the face until she was black and blue.</p>

<p>At this point, the dream-elf, thinking
his work well done, hastened back to
Mount Fern. On the way he met Tono
floating about on the wings of song. Each
elf related what he had done since they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
parted, and both laughed heartily at the
fun they had had with the Giant World.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said Slumber, the dream-elf,
&#8220;won&#8217;t you sing the Swan song before
you retire?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; said Tono, &#8220;to so small an
audience, but I&#8217;ll drink your health in a
glass of honeydew before we say good-night.&#8221;</p>

<span class="smcap">The Lawn Party</span></h2></div>


<p>Early the next evening, Captain Featherweight
commanded Iris-Wing to take a
pitcher-plant and go in search of honeydew
for breakfast.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m tired of lilydew,&#8221; said the
Captain, &#8220;get clover honeydew&mdash;and I
prefer the red clover to the white.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this command, the flower-elf hurried
off in the direction of the apple orchard,
for it was only yesterday that he had seen
fine red clover under the apple trees.</p>

<p>After he had filled his pitcher-plant
with the sweet red clover honeydew, he
went into the rose garden to see how the
roses were growing. They were all doing
beautifully, and especially the American
Beauty Rose, who was very tall and
stately.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad to see you,&#8221; said she to
the flower-elf. &#8220;I&#8217;m feeling blue: it&#8217;s not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
so very gay here, and we need something
to cheer us up. Can&#8217;t you persuade Captain
Featherweight to give a ball and invite
the flowers? I know he&#8217;s very hospitable
or I would not ask it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A request from you is a command as
well as a compliment,&#8221; said the flower-elf,
&#8220;and you honor us all in the asking.&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying, Iris-Wing bowed low to the
American Beauty Rose, and waved his
hand in adieu. But as the flower-elf was
leaving the rose garden he heard some
one sobbing, and looking up, he saw that
he was directly under Anna&#8217;s bedroom
window. So up he flew and sat on the
window ledge, for he wanted to know if
her dream had made her change her mind
about the bluebird feathers.</p>

<p>Between her sobs she was telling Mary
her dream, and when she had finished,
she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate the birds! I won&#8217;t have them
in the garden any longer! I&#8217;ll get Papa
to pull down all the bird houses and chain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
a cat to every tree! I&#8217;m almost scared to
death!&#8221;</p>

<p>The flower-elf chuckled merrily to himself,
and started back to Mount Fern.</p>

<p>When he reached the mulberry tree
which stood in the middle of the garden,
he heard a &#8220;Caw! Caw! Caw!&#8221; and looking
up, saw Colonel Claw perching on
one of the lower branches. Colonel Claw
belonged to the Crow family, and always
dressed in black.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Colonel Claw,&#8221; said
Iris-Wing. &#8220;Welcome to Templeton
Garden! How long do you expect to stay
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That depends on circumstances,&#8221; said
Colonel Claw. &#8220;I&#8217;m on duty here; I&#8217;ve
been sent to look after the interests of the
bluebirds and to report to General Grosbeak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re doubly welcome, for our
interests are the same,&#8221; said Iris-Wing.
&#8220;May I offer you some honeydew? It&#8217;s
red clover.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I thank you,&#8221; said Colonel Claw,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
&#8220;I prefer grasshoppers and caterpillars
when I&#8217;m hungry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I catch you some?&#8221; asked the
flower-elf.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, no,&#8221; said Colonel Claw,
&#8220;it&#8217;s my rule never to breakfast until five
o&#8217;clock, and I prefer them fresh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you very hungry?&#8221; asked the
flower-elf.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, <i>very</i>,&#8221; said the Colonel, &#8220;but I
belong to the army, and discipline must
be maintained.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Iris-Wing bowed low to Colonel
Claw and bade him good evening, saying
that he hoped to see him soon at Mount
Fern.</p>

<p>When Iris-Wing reached Mount Fern
he found that breakfast was ready, and so
all the elves sat down and drank the red
clover honeydew which he had brought
from the apple orchard, with some berries
and nuts, which was their usual breakfast
fare.</p>

<p>While they sat at the table the flower-elf
related all he had seen, and heard, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
done that evening. He told the elves that
Colonel Claw was in the neighborhood,
and had taken up his abode in the mulberry
tree. And when he repeated the
conversation he had had with that gentleman,
Captain Featherweight commanded
Lightning, the messenger-elf, to catch
some grasshoppers and caterpillars for
Colonel Claw just in time for his breakfast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give him my compliments,&#8221; said Captain
Featherweight, &#8220;and tell him that I
shall give myself the pleasure of calling
upon him tomorrow evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I saw the American Beauty
Rose,&#8221; continued the flower-elf, &#8220;and she
wants you to give a ball and invite the
flowers. She needs to be cheered up. She
said she was feeling blue, although she
looked very red and rosy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One thing at a time,&#8221; said the Captain,
&#8220;for I&#8217;ve just decided to have a lawn
party for the Elves of Oakdale, and Lightning
will carry them the invitations this
very evening.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Captain Featherweight of Mount Fern presents
his compliments to Captain Acorn of Oakdale, and
begs that Captain Acorn and his Company will favor
Captain Featherweight and his Company with their
presence at Mount Fern on Thursday next by the
light of the moon.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>This was the form of the invitation,
and Lightning carried it at once to Oakdale.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what shall I say to the American
Beauty Rose?&#8221; asked the flower-elf, when
Lightning had gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;My best respects to the American
Beauty,&#8221; said Captain Featherweight,
&#8220;and tell her that it will give us much
pleasure to entertain the flowers; and that
the ball shall be given two weeks from to-night
in honor of the Queen of Flowers,
which, as you know, is the rose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the flower-elf departed for the
rose garden to carry Captain Featherweight&#8217;s
invitation to the flowers, and before
long Lightning was seen in the distance
hurrying back with Captain Acorn&#8217;s
reply, which ran thus:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Captain Acorn of Oakdale presents his compliments
to Captain Featherweight of Mount Fern, and
accepts with much pleasure for himself and his
Company the most kind invitation of Captain
Featherweight of Mount Fern.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said the Captain, when he
had read the reply, &#8220;we must prepare for
our guests. The finest piece of lawn is
under the great white oak tree, and there
we will play skyball. Between now and
Thursday I want you to pull up and carry
away all the tall blades of grass, and beat
down with our feet all the rough places,
so that the lawn will be as smooth as
velvet.</p>

<p>&#8220;And, Lightning!&#8221; continued the Captain,
&#8220;we shall need new balls and mallets
for the occasion, so go to the Dwarfs of
Cavedale, and tell them to have them
ready for Thursday next.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of what shall the Dwarfs make
them?&#8221; asked Lightning.</p>

<p>&#8220;The balls shall be made of purest rubber,
the mallet heads of finest ivory, and
the handles of blackest ebony.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>&#8220;And how large shall they be, noble
Captain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let the balls be as large as three times
a sweet-pea seed, and the mallets as large
as the stamens of the Tiger-Lily.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Iris-Wing, you shall have charge of
collecting the nectar, as well as providing
the fans for the party.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what shall we use for fans?&#8221;
asked the flower-elf.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said the Captain, &#8220;the leaves
of nasturtium.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And shall we have music?&#8221; asked Tono.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, after the game we&#8217;ll have music,
and you shall have charge of it, Tono; I
leave the selection entirely to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Owly,&#8221; continued the Captain,
&#8220;please remember that you are not responsible
for the mistakes of our guests,
for if I catch you correcting anyone, I&#8217;ll
send you to Doomdell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Doomdell is as bad for the elves as
prison is for us, and Captain Featherweight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
knew very well how to frighten
Owly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Rainbow, on account of your tact,
I put you in charge of the whole affair.
You must oversee the others and be sure
that their work is well done.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Elves of Mount Fern were as busy
as bees all that week, and when Thursday
evening came round they were ready for
their guests.</p>

<p>Captain Featherweight was always
prompt, and if he had anything to do, he
always got it done in time.</p>

<p>When the moon was high in the sky the
Elves of Oakdale arrived at Mount Fern.
And after the greetings were over, they
all sat down on fresh green moss-mounds
which had been brought in for the occasion.</p>

<p>Then Rainbow, who was master of ceremonies,
commanded Lightning to pass
around some apple-blossom honeydew in
bluebell cups; and after they had partaken
of the sparkling nectar, Captain Featherweight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
arm-in-arm with Captain Acorn,
led the way to Oaktree Lawn.</p>

<p>When they were all assembled there,
Lightning presented Captain Acorn with
the choicest of the mallets and balls, and
the play began.</p>

<p>In Skyball the target is the face of the
moon, and the player who comes nearest
the mark, wins the game.</p>

<p>Captain Acorn, as guest, had first play.</p>

<p>Rainbow held his ball for him, and as
soon as Captain Acorn called out &#8220;ready,&#8221;
Rainbow dropped the ball, which Captain
Acorn with one tremendous swing sent
whizzing off toward the moon. Lightning
followed the ball, and placed a stake where
it fell.</p>

<p>Captain Featherweight played next,
and he was followed by Okla of Oakdale.</p>

<p>Then it was Rainbow&#8217;s turn, and he was
followed by another of the Elves of Oakdale,
and so on, until all the Elves of Oakdale,
and all the Elves of Mount Fern,
had played.</p>

<p>When the game was over they all flew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
off to look at the stakes, and it was found
that Captain Acorn&#8217;s ball was nearest the
moon.</p>

<p>It was a jolly game, and Captain Featherweight,
who did not think it polite to
win on his own grounds, was very glad
that Captain Acorn was able to carry off
the cup.</p>

<p>It was only a simple buttercup, but, although
they grew in plenty everywhere,
Captain Acorn was just as proud as if it
had been made of silver or gold, for the
<i>honor</i> was just as great.</p>

<p>When the game was over Lightning
gave each elf a fan, and while they were
resting and fanning themselves, he passed
red clover honeydew in lily-cups.</p>

<p>Then Tono and his orchestra played and
sang some beautiful music. Their musical
instruments were blades of grass, wind-flowers,
Canterbury bells, and trumpet
honeysuckles.</p>

<p>First they played and sang:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Moon and Stars</i></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Said the moon to the stars: &#8216;You are always the same,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; And your lights are so tiny, I think them quite tame;</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; You just twinkle and twinkle in red, white and blue,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Have you noticed the wonderful things I can do?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;&#8216;Sometimes I&#8217;m a crescent, a pale silver line,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; An arc of a circle&mdash;I think it quite fine.</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Then again I am round, with my face full of light,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; And everyone thinks me a wonderful sight.&#8217;&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>&#8220;That is really fine,&#8221; said Captain
Acorn. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you favor us with something
else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With pleasure,&#8221; answered Tono, and
then he and his orchestra played and sang
<i>Three Crows</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">&#8220;Three crows there were once who sat on a tree,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Fa-lo, fa-la, fa-lee!</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Said one &#8216;I should like to sail o&#8217;er the sea,&#8217;</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Fa-lo, fa-la, fa-lee!</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; The other two looked so gloomy and blue,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Fa-lo, fa-la, fa-lee!</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Said they: &#8216;If you do, we&#8217;ll surely go too,&#8217;</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Fa-lo, fa-la, fa-lee!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>I should have said they <i>tried</i> to play
<i>Three Crows</i>, for they had no sooner
started than Colonel Claw, who was sitting
on a branch of the mulberry tree and
watching the whole performance, set up
such a &#8220;Caw! caw! caw!&#8221; that Tono was
obliged to stop the music and try something
else.</p>

<p>After that they sang about the silvery
swans, and Colonel Claw became quite
quiet and subdued, for it did not interest
him in the least when they sang of other
people.</p>

<p>Then Captain Acorn thanked Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Featherweight for the game and the music
and said it was now time to sing <i>Oh, Joy
to be Elves!</i> This was the song that the
elves always sang at parting.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Oh, Joy to be Elves!</div>

<div class="verse">&nbsp; Oh, joy to be fairies,</div>

<div class="indent">To sail o&#8217;er the sea,</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>Then Captain Acorn and his Company
bade adieu to the Elves of Mount Fern,
saying that they hoped to see them soon
at Oakdale.</p>

<p>Thus ended the lawn party.</p>

<span class="smcap">The Ball</span></h2></div>


<p>The next evening, at starlight, Captain
Featherweight said it was time to begin
preparations for the ball.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ballroom shall be the soft velvet
lawn under the Linden tree, and we&#8217;ll
dance by the light of the pale silver moon.
But we&#8217;ll have to provide ourselves with
fireflies too, in case a cloud should cover
up the moon.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, Owly, you will please be diligent
in catching fireflies between now and next
Thursday evening, for I want thousands
of them. So many fireflies, tied by gossamer
threads to the lower branches of the
Linden tree, will make us quite independent
of the moon.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Lightning,&#8221; continued the Captain,
&#8220;it shall be your duty to provide
seats for the ladies, and I know of none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
more comfortable than fresh green moss-mounds.
And we&#8217;ll arrange them in a
circle around the Linden tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Tono, you will of course have
charge of the music, and I want you to
invite the butterflies to accompany the
orchestra.&#8221;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;The butterflies&#8217; soft minstrelsy</div>
<div class="indent">Shall tune our hearts to sweet accord,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; But beetles, wasps, and bumblebees,</div>
<div class="indent">We cannot have, they&#8217;re much too forward.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Our berries, fruits, and honeydew</div>
<div class="indent">Would disappear by magic sure,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; If we these creatures should invite&mdash;</div>
<div class="indent">Their very names I can&#8217;t endure!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;The flowers we&#8217;ll invite this time,</div>
<div class="indent">And by the fireflies&#8217; light we&#8217;ll see</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Their various shades of every hue,</div>
<div class="indent">And all their gorgeous broidery&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>said Rhymo, who never lost an opportunity
to make poetry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you a little late with the last
verse?&#8221; asked Owly. &#8220;We&#8217;ve already invited
the flowers. If you <i>must</i> make poetry,
why not try to make it in time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good poetry is always in time,&#8221; said
Rhymo. &#8220;Just ask Captain Featherweight
if that isn&#8217;t so.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the Captain was far too busy to pay
much attention to Rhymo and Owly. He
was thinking about the girdles.</p>

<p>There is nothing an elf prizes so much
as a girdle, and Captain Featherweight
decided to have special girdles made just
for the ball in honor of the flowers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rainbow,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and you too, Iris-Wing,
shall have charge of designing the
girdles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And see that each one is appropriate,&#8221;
said Touchstone, &#8220;and since Owly is so
very wise, let his girdle be made of Solomon&#8217;s-Seal.&#8221;</p>

<p>This pleased the other elves so much
that they asked the Captain to allow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Touchstone to help in designing all the
girdles.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think any one as silly as Touchstone
should have charge of anything,&#8221;
said Owly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have a care,&#8221; said Touchstone, &#8220;or
your girdle shall be made of Nettles instead
of Solomon&#8217;s-Seal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m bored,&#8221; said Owly, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll just
run away until the girdle question is settled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what shall the dream-elf&#8217;s be
made of?&#8221; asked Iris-Wing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, of Eyebright and Wake-Robin,&#8221;
said Touchstone.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Rhymo&#8217;s shall be made of Laurel
leaves,&#8221; said Rainbow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not of Poet-Asters?&#8221; asked
Touchstone.</p>

<p>But the other elves paid no attention
to this joke, and Touchstone continued:
&#8220;When it comes to my turn, I want to
decide for myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Lightning, our swift-footed messenger&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
girdle shall be made of the common
Speedwell,&#8221; said Iris-Wing.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Tono&#8217;s shall be made of the Bluebells
of Scotland,&#8221; said Rainbow.</p>

<p>&#8220;And mine,&#8221; said Touchstone, &#8220;shall
be made of the Jewel-weed, for a jester is
always a jewel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Rainbow&#8217;s,&#8221; said the flower-elf,
&#8220;shall be made of the blue Forget-Me-Not,
for he will always be remembered on account
of his sweetness and tact.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Iris-Wing&#8217;s shall be made of the
elves&#8217; favorite flower, the tall pink Foxglove,&#8221;
said Rainbow.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now for our Captain&#8217;s! Three
cheers for the kindest of Captains! His
girdle shall be made of roses&mdash;to show that
his Company loves him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rainbow,&#8221; said the Captain, &#8220;I appoint
you Master of Ceremonies. You
shall have charge of everything, and if any
disputes arise, you must settle them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right! Left! Shoulder arms!&#8221;</p>

<p>This, as you know, meant, &#8220;Get to
work.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>At this command every elf scampered
off in high glee.</p>

<p>Rainbow, Iris-Wing, and Touchstone
went at once to Cavedale to talk with the
Dwarfs about the girdles for the ball. And
they decided that they should all be of
finely wrought silver, except the Captain&#8217;s
which should be made of pure gold.</p>

<p>Owly went in search of fireflies and
brought home hundreds of them that first
night, for an elf can fly faster than fireflies,
and has no trouble in catching them
if they can only be found.</p>

<p>Lightning went in search of moss-mounds,
and flew back and forth so swiftly
between Mount Fern and the soft
woodsy dells where the moss-mounds grow
that the very first evening he had almost
enough for the ball.</p>

<p>But when he showed them to Rainbow,
he found that some of them were not fresh
enough, or fine enough, or high enough, or
low enough, or large enough, or small
enough, or firm enough, or soft enough;
and he had to throw half of them away,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and go in quest of more. Rainbow was
very particular, and perfection was his
law of life.</p>

<p>So the preparations went on, and when
Thursday evening came around the busy
little elves had everything in readiness.
And when the hour of the ball drew nigh,
they were waiting to receive their guests.</p>

<p>The Elves of Mount Fern looked beautiful
that summer evening. All were elegantly
dressed, and each was looking his
very best, for the Dwarfs had taken great
pains with the girdles.</p>

<p>Captain Featherweight was dressed in
purple and gold, because, as he said to the
other elves, kings and queens from time
immemorial had always dressed in purple
and gold; and as he was the representative
in Templeton Gardens of the King and
Queen of the elves, it was only right that
he should dress to honor his rank.</p>

<p>Rainbow was dressed in pale blue, and
with his girdle of Forget-Me-Not and a
white lace collar he looked more like a
flower than an elf.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>Rhymo, the poet-elf, was dressed in
white and green&mdash;and of course his girdle
of Laurel leaves, which the three elves
had designed and the Dwarfs of Cavedale
had wrought.</p>

<p>Slumber, the dream-elf, was dressed in
silvery grey, and in addition to his girdle
of Eyebright and Wake-Robin, he wore a
Poppy in his hair, for the Poppy, as you
know, is the emblem of forgetfulness. But
it was only a silver Poppy, not a real
Poppy of course, for the ball was in honor
of the flowers, and <i>all</i> the flowers were
expected to join in the dance.</p>

<p>The Linden tree was a magnificent sight
that summer evening, with its myriads
of tiny fireflies twinkling like little stars.
It was like giant candelabra in the centre
of a ballroom, only far more beautiful.
And the lawn underneath was as smooth
as the smoothest velvet, and at regular
intervals there were soft comfortable seats
of fresh green moss-mounds.</p>

<p>Rhymo saw the flowers coming and
burst forth into verse:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;At last the gala night appeared,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; The moon was bright, the air was clear,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; And just at twelve from far and near,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; The flowers in couples did appear.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Captain Featherweight was radiant in
his golden girdle of roses. When the
flowers appeared he and the other elves
greeted them graciously, and led each one
to a comfortable seat made of soft green
moss-mounds.</p>

<p>Then Rainbow gave a signal to Tono
and the music began.</p>

<p>The opening music was <i>Welcome to
Mount Fern!</i></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;O welcome to Mount Fern,</div>
<div class="indent">Ye flowers bright and gay,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Your presence would brighten</div>
<div class="indent">The rosiest day;</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Your smiles and your sunshine</div>
<div class="indent">Great happiness bring,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; So mortals and fairies</div>
<div class="indent">Your praises do sing!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>Tono had composed the music and
Rhymo the words, just for the occasion,
and the beautiful flowers bowed their
heads in grateful acknowledgment of the
compliment that had been paid them.</p>

<p>When the opening music had ceased,
Captain Featherweight declared that it
was now time to open the ball, and with a
very low bow he offered his arm to the
American Beauty Rose, led her to the
centre of the lawn, and the dance began.</p>

<p>&#8220;How beautiful you are to-night,&#8221; said
the Captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because I&#8217;m happy to be in such
good company,&#8221; said the American Beauty.
&#8220;But I&#8217;m not always so happy, and
lately I&#8217;ve been feeling quite blue. What
<i>do</i> you think Doctor Templeton is going
to do with the Roses? Why, only a week
ago, I heard him telling his wife that he
thought it looked more dignified to have
nothing but <i>lawn</i> in the front of the house,
and that he thought he would move the
Rose garden to the back of the house near
the shrubbery. I don&#8217;t know when I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
felt so humiliated! I really don&#8217;t think
I could stand it! Why, when I lived at
White Oaks, I was the pride of the family,
and was given the most prominent part
of the garden, in front of the parlor window.
And every morning early, and many
times through the day, Mrs. Chesterton
came to see me. And she called me
&#8216;Queenie&#8217; and &#8216;Beauty,&#8217; and said I was a
joy and delight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so you are,&#8221; said the Captain,
&#8220;for everyone knows that the Rose is the
queen of all flowers.&#8221;</p>

<p>These kind words quite cheered up the
American Beauty, and she blushed a deeper
crimson as she and the Captain glided
away over the soft velvet lawn.</p>

<p>Rhymo was dancing with a Pansy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at that Daffodil over there,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;see how gloomy he looks, and
the Amaranth is trying to cheer him up.
I&#8217;ll make a verse about him&mdash;if you are
fond of poetry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, very,&#8221; said the Pansy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>&#8220;Then listen to this,&#8221; said Rhymo, &#8220;and
remember it, for it is worth remembering:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;A Daffodil walked past in gloom,</div>
<div class="indent">And a friar&#8217;s coat his form encased;</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; He boasted Mediterranean birth,</div>
<div class="indent">The lawn with solemn mien he paced.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;The Amaranth took him by the hand,</div>
<div class="indent">And whispered words of faith and cheer:</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; &#8216;Another glorious world awaits</div>
<div class="indent">The spirits of our departed dear&#8217;.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s beautiful,&#8221; said the Pansy,
&#8220;but I don&#8217;t know anyone more sorrowful
than the Hyacinth, and if I were Captain
Featherweight I wouldn&#8217;t invite either
him or the Daffodil to a dance. Isn&#8217;t he
afraid they&#8217;ll spoil his party?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He couldn&#8217;t leave them out, you
know,&#8221; said Rhymo, &#8220;because all the
flowers were invited; and besides, they
won&#8217;t hurt anyone. And even if they
should, Tono&#8217;s music would soon cheer one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
up again. Shall I put the Hyacinth into
verse for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please do,&#8221; said the Pansy.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;The Hyacinth and Poppy next,</div>
<div class="indent">Went walking side by side,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; The Hyacinth was sorrowful,</div>
<div class="indent">His grief he could not hide.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;The Poppy soothed him as a child,</div>
<div class="indent">Told him his griefs were vain:</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; &#8216;Forget your sorrows, Sir,&#8217; she said,</div>
<div class="indent">&#8216;Their ev&#8217;ry pang disdain.&#8217;&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>&#8220;I declare I feel blue,&#8221; said the Pansy.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t you think of anything more cheerful
than grief and sorrow, Rhymo?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; said the poet-elf. &#8220;All
the flowers are more cheerful than the
Daffodil and Hyacinth, and we&#8217;ll not think
of them any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at that vain Narcissus,&#8221; said
the Pansy, &#8220;he always makes me angry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll put him into verse too if you&#8217;ll be
kind enough to listen,&#8221; said the poet-elf.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; said the Pansy, who was
very good-natured.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re an angel,&#8221; said Rhymo, &#8220;you
are so appreciative.&#8221;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;On the arm of a vain Narcissus, next,</div>
<div class="indent">Was seen a Violet hanging low,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Her modesty did but enhance</div>
<div class="indent">His egotism all aglow.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine,&#8221; said the Pansy, &#8220;but suppose
you lead me to a seat and finish your
verses afterwards, for I&#8217;m beginning to
feel a little tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they were seated comfortably on
one of the fresh green moss-mounds, a
Tulip and a Lily-of-the-Valley waltzed
past them, and Rhymo burst again into
verse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;The Tulip did appropriate</div>
<div class="indent">The Lily-of-the-Valley sweet,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; With manly stride and bow profound,</div>
<div class="indent">He led her to a vacant seat.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>&#8220;Keep right on with your poetry,&#8221; said
the Pansy. &#8220;Don&#8217;t stop to give comments,
but make a verse as each couple passes
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the most delightful partner
I&#8217;ve ever had,&#8221; said the poet-elf, &#8220;you&#8217;re
so sympathetic.&#8221;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;The beautiful Forget-Me-Not</div>
<div class="indent">Was lover, true and tried,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Of dainty Daisy innocent,&mdash;</div>
<div class="indent">And he walked by her side.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;A red Rose danced with a Lily fair,</div>
<div class="indent">And he said as he whispered in her ear,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; &#8216;My pure sweet Lily, you are my queen,</div>
<div class="indent">I love you, dear. I love you, dear!&#8217;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;The gorgeous Sunflower, bold and brave,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Approached the shy, white Cyclamen&mdash;&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But here the poet-elf looked hard at
the Pansy, and saw that she was fainting;
so he brought her a drink of water, in an
acorn cup, and begged her pardon a
thousand times.</p>

<p>&#8220;And please don&#8217;t tell Captain Featherweight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
about the poetry,&#8221; implored Rhymo,
&#8220;for if he thinks I&#8217;ve bored you, he&#8217;ll
send me to Doomdell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Rainbow came along and asked
the Pansy for the favor of a dance; and
Rhymo, who saw no one without a partner,
sat on a moss-mound and watched the
dancers.</p>

<p>The music was grand, and the flap! flap!
of the butterflies&#8217; wings beat time with the
strains of the orchestra.</p>

<p>The Elves were happy and so were their
guests, for Captain Featherweight was a
charming host, and even the Daffodil and
Hyacinth were enjoying themselves.</p>

<p>The flowers were truly beautiful, and
were so light and airy in their movements
that it was a delight to watch them. And
they danced until the morning light
dimmed the glow of the fireflies; and then
all the flowers, led by the American
Beauty Rose, thanked Captain Featherweight
for the honor he had done them,
curtsied low to him and all his company,
and bade them adieu.</p>

<p>Thus ended the ball.</p>

<span class="smcap">Emily&#8217;s Birthday</span></h2></div>


<p>At starlight the next evening the Elves
of Mount Fern were up and about their
business as usual.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said the Captain, &#8220;that we&#8217;ll
stay here for a long time. I like the
neighborhood. I like the trees and the
garden and the birds; and I think we&#8217;re
just as well off here as anywhere else for
the present. I&#8217;m fond of Colonel Claw,
too; he&#8217;s a good fellow even if he is a
crow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Speaking of angels makes them appear,&#8221;
said Touchstone, &#8220;for here he
comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Colonel Claw arrived at Mount
Fern he was cordially welcomed by all the
Elves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have a perch,&#8221; said the Captain, &#8220;and
make yourself at home.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>Rainbow thought of everything, and as
soon as he knew that Colonel Claw was in
the neighborhood he had the branch of a
tree brought in and fixed in one of the
cracks of the wall, for it isn&#8217;t good form
for a crow to sit on a chair or a moss-mound.</p>

<p>&#8220;I just dropped in to see if you intended
to celebrate Emily&#8217;s birthday in any
way,&#8221; said Colonel Claw. &#8220;It is only a
week from today, and as the bluebirds&#8217;
house is still undisturbed I thought it
would not be amiss to call a council of the
birds in the neighborhood, and see if they
would be willing to serenade her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A capital idea,&#8221; said Captain Featherweight,
&#8220;for nothing adds so much to a
festive occasion as good music. And I
don&#8217;t know any music more delightful
than a bird chorus.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought myself of engaging the insect
choir to serenade her, but before deciding
that, I wished to consult you. I
want the choir to perform in the evening,
and I wondered if the insects would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
be safe from the Night-Hawks and Whippoorwills.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They surely will for that one evening,&#8221;
said Colonel Claw, &#8220;for I&#8217;ll send a carrier-pigeon
with a note to General Grosbeak
this very evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How will this do?&#8221;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Colonel Claw presents his compliments to General
Grosbeak. He begs to state that Emily Templeton&#8217;s
birthday is a week from today, and craves his
kind permission to issue a proclamation to Night-Hawks,
Whippoorwills, and other insect-destroyers to
stay away from Templeton Gardens on the evening
of that day, as it is hoped that the insect choir will
take part in the celebration of Emily&#8217;s birthday.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;That is excellent,&#8221; said Captain Featherweight,
&#8220;but do you think he will
grant your request?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll know,&#8221; said Colonel Claw, &#8220;that
I wouldn&#8217;t have asked this for Emily if
anything had happened to the bluebirds&#8217;
house.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Colonel Claw departed, saying
that he hoped to be able soon to show Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Featherweight General Grosbeak&#8217;s
reply.</p>

<p>After he had gone, the Captain called
his elves together to decide what they
should give Emily for a birthday present.</p>

<p>&#8220;I move that we give her a violin, so
that she can have music wherever she
goes,&#8221; said Tono.</p>

<p>&#8220;A violin isn&#8217;t music,&#8221; said Owly, &#8220;and
how could she have music wherever she
goes when she can&#8217;t even play a note?
You&#8217;re so unpractical, Tono. Let&#8217;s hear
a suggestion from some one else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suggest a book of poems,&#8221; said Rhymo,
&#8220;and I&#8217;ll add some of my own. A
book never gets out of tune, and is a constant
source of delight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That depends entirely on the book,&#8221;
said Owly, who didn&#8217;t at all approve of
Rhymo&#8217;s suggestion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think a bouquet would be
nicer than anything else?&#8221; asked the
flower-elf.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Owly, &#8220;because the house
will be full of them anyway. That would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
be like carrying fish to a fisherman. Can
no one think of anything more suitable
and appropriate?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can,&#8221; said Slumber, &#8220;for I dreamed
only last night that Emily wanted a necklace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The best suggestion I have heard,&#8221;
said the Captain. &#8220;A necklace is just the
thing, and I&#8217;ll send Lightning this very
evening to the Dwarfs of Cavedale to ask
them to have it ready for her birthday.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Tono, you will please compose
some music for the occasion, and Rhymo
will make some verses to suit the music.
Or perhaps it would be better the other
way around, but I leave that entirely to
you.</p>

<p>&#8220;With the insect choir, the bird chorus,
the elfin choir and orchestra, Emily&#8217;s
birthday will be very well celebrated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I make a verse to accompany the
necklace?&#8221; asked Rhymo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bad idea,&#8221; said the Captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I engage the insect choir?&#8221;
asked Lightning.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>&#8220;That is my business,&#8221; said Tono.
&#8220;Anything that has to do with music, you
will please leave to me. I&#8217;ll attend to that
this very evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; said Captain Featherweight,
&#8220;not unless we hear from Colonel
Claw. How would you like to have the
insect choir devoured in the midst of the
serenade?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the music-elf bowed low to the
Captain in token of obedience, and said:
&#8220;Your word is law, noble Captain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right! Left! Shoulder arms!&#8221; called
the Captain.</p>

<p>At this command every elf scampered
off and went to work. Iris-Wing went into
the orchard to see if the bees that had been
working there during the day had done
their work well. But the flower-elf did
not think so, and he called at the honey-bees&#8217;
hive to say that he was not quite
satisfied.</p>

<p>The bees were very indignant that the
quality of their work should be questioned,
until the flower-elf explained that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
elves had charge of the growing of plants,
and that he was responsible for Templeton
Grounds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Featherweight,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is
very strict, and if I don&#8217;t make a good
report I&#8217;ll lose my place and be sent to
Doomdell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We understand,&#8221; said the bees, &#8220;and
accept your apology.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then, of course, it may perhaps
be barely possible,&#8221; suggested a sister bee,
&#8220;that the work of the dying honey-bee was
somewhat at fault.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>These verses made the flower-elf very
thoughtful&mdash;so thoughtful that he flew
straight into Rainbow, who was flying in
another direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse <i>me</i>!&#8221; exclaimed Rainbow;
which meant, of course, &#8220;Excuse <i>you</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>And when Iris-Wing recited the story of
the dying honey-bee, Rainbow almost shed
a tear&mdash;a thing that had never been heard
of among the Elves of Mount Fern.</p>

<p>Then Iris-Wing passed on to the veranda
where the Doctor&#8217;s daughters, Mary
and Anna, were shelling peas for the cook.
He felt very indignant whenever he
thought of the bluebird feathers, even
though they were safe in the nest, for he
felt sure that Anna still had the <i>will</i> to rob
the birds. He wore his invisible cap, and
could see and not be seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m tired shelling peas,&#8221; said Anna,
&#8220;and I don&#8217;t see why the cook can&#8217;t shell
them herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know Mother told us that she
wouldn&#8217;t have time tomorrow,&#8221; said
Mary, &#8220;and I think it is fun anyway.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
The poor peas have never seen the
light except through a thick veil. They
are really prisoners and we are helping to
set them free.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are always thinking of such queer
things, Mary, that I don&#8217;t believe you feel
about anything as other people do.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Anna soon went to work with a will,
and in a short time the peas were all
shelled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take them into the kitchen,&#8221; said
Mary, &#8220;and while I&#8217;m gone, suppose you
go after the clothes that we&#8217;re making for
Emily&#8217;s doll.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a short time they were both on the
veranda again, and very busily engaged
in sewing for Emily&#8217;s birthday.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are we going to do for feathers
for the mattress and pillows?&#8221; asked
Mary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, haven&#8217;t I told you?&#8221; asked Anna.
&#8220;I asked Mother about it, and she
said she had a pillow which she didn&#8217;t
need and that we might have it for
Emily&#8217;s doll. If I&#8217;d only asked her in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the first place, I don&#8217;t believe I would have
had that horrible dream.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the flower-elf heard this, he departed,
for he had a great many things to
attend to that evening.</p>

<p>He wanted to see how the wildflowers
were growing in the woods nearby, for it
occurred to him that although Emily
might have all the cultivated flowers that
she wished for on her birthday, a bouquet
of wildflowers could not be amiss. So off
he started in search of them, and when he
was quite sure that he knew exactly where
all the different kinds grew, he flew back
to Mount Fern.</p>

<p>When he arrived there, he found that all
the other elves were at home and were
listening to General Grosbeak&#8217;s reply,
which Colonel Claw had just brought over.
It ran thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;General Grosbeak presents his compliments to
Colonel Claw, and begs to state that it will give him
much pleasure to issue an order to all insect-destroyers
to avoid the grounds of Templeton Hall
on the evening of Emily&#8217;s birthday.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>&#8220;And now, Tono,&#8221; said Captain Featherweight,
&#8220;you have my full permission
to go ahead and do your best for Emily&#8217;s
birthday.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Lightning, you may go now to the
Dwarfs of Cavedale and tell them to have
the necklace ready for a week from to-night.
And let it be wrought of fine filigree gold,&mdash;in
a dainty design of lilies and
roses.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the Captain had given commands
to all the elves as to what the duty of each
should be for the following week, they all
ran away and began to make plans for
their work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tono,&#8221; said Rhymo, &#8220;I want your advice.
You know I have to make a verse
to accompany the necklace; how would
this do?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;A necklace by the elves designed</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Of rose and lily intertwined,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; And by the Dwarfs of Cavedale wrought:</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; A birthday gift to you we&#8217;ve brought.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>&#8220;It may be all right,&#8221; said Tono, &#8220;but
if I were you I&#8217;d make several, and then
let the Captain decide which he likes
best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A very fine idea,&#8221; said Rhymo, who
liked nothing better than making verses,
&#8220;and I&#8217;ll compose something bright and
gay, for we must not forget it&#8217;s for a
festive occasion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll just go now,&#8221; said Tono, &#8220;and see
that all the musical instruments are in
perfect tune.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Rhymo was left alone he busied
himself with making verses that should
be both happy and pleasing, trying first
one rhyme and then another, and wondering
which would please Emily most. For
Captain Featherweight had told him that
the object of birthday parties was to make
the owner of the birthday glad and happy!</p>

<p>When the verses were finished he
brought them to Tono, who was busy
selecting the insect choir and testing their
voices so that there should be no discordant
note. This was the insects&#8217; first lesson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
from Tono, and after a careful practice
he dismissed them, saying, that the next
rehearsal should be the following evening
at the same place and hour.</p>

<p>As soon as the insects were gone, the
elfin choir appeared, accompanied by the
elfin orchestra with their wind instruments,
stringed instruments, cymbals and
drums. And Tono took the verses which
Rhymo had made and set them to music,
and never before in all their experience
had the elfin choir and orchestra received
such a drilling and training.</p>

<p>And at the same place and hour every
night for a week, the elfin musicians came
to the practice.</p>

<p>Every elf was busily engaged in doing
his best for Emily&#8217;s birthday, for if the
Elves of Mount Fern undertook to do
work, they always aimed at perfection.</p>

<p>Lightning was busy in all sorts of ways,
for whenever there was a message to send
or an errand to run, the Captain always
called on Lightning.</p>

<p>Rainbow was a kind of court of last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
appeal before the time came for the final
rehearsal on the eve of Emily&#8217;s birthday,
when Captain Featherweight was to judge
of everything.</p>

<p>Colonel Claw, too, was busy all that
week selecting the sweetest singers for the
bird chorus; for although he did not sing
himself, but only conversed, he was very
particular as to the birds he should ask
to take part in the celebration.</p>

<p>So he invited the musical Blackbird, but
as he is a very great mimic, Colonel
Claw warned him to be on his guard
against imitating the rough and hoarse
notes of other birds. He also invited the
Bobolink, the Song Sparrow, the Vesper
Sparrow, the Wood Pewee, the Indigo
Bunting, the Robin, the Purple Finch, the
Vireo, the Meadow Lark, the Veery, the
Hermit Thrush, the Bluebird, and all the
Warblers who might serve as a background
or accompaniment.</p>

<p>The Cedar Bird was Colonel Claw&#8217;s
great problem, because, as he said, &#8220;His
voice is inferior.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>But he knew the Cedar Bird would be
very much hurt if he did not invite him,
and he knew too that Dr. Templeton and
all his family were particularly fond of
the Cedar Bird family. And so Colonel
Claw was puzzled and perplexed, and he
carried his difficulty to Rainbow and laid
the case before him.</p>

<p>Rainbow advised Colonel Claw to invite
the Cedar Bird, &#8220;For,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it is to
be such a gay and festive occasion that
there should be no sad hearts in Templeton
Garden. But tell him to be sure to
sing softly, softly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear sir, kind sir,&#8221; said Colonel Claw,
&#8220;you are always so amiable, and your
counsel so admirable, that I take your advice;
your wish is my law.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so Colonel Claw invited the Cedar
Bird, and <i>he</i> kept saying &#8220;softly,&#8221; &#8220;softly,&#8221;
so that there should be no mistake as to
what was required of him.</p>

<p>And all the birds entered into the spirit
of the celebration, and came each day in
joyous throngs to the practice. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
greatly excited all that week, for they had
never before been asked to take part in
the festivities of a little girl&#8217;s birthday.
And they spent far more time than usual
in preening their feathers and taking their
baths, until they felt that they were looking
their very best.</p>

<p>The insects, too, were very particular
about their appearance, and swam and
dove in the pool of the fountain, and dried
themselves in the sun so that there should
be no particles of dust sticking to them.</p>

<p>And on Thursday, the great day, Colonel
Claw, Tono, and Rainbow marched
all the birds and insects down to the river
for their final bath and preening.</p>

<p>They used the surface of the water as
a mirror. And when they were perfectly
clean, Colonel Claw commanded all the
birds to alight on the nearest tree to plume
and arrange their feathers.</p>

<p>And Tono, who had charge of the insects,
told them to fly to some shrubs that
were growing near the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I blow three blasts on my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
bugle,&#8221; said Tono, &#8220;fly quickly to Templeton
Garden and alight on the flowering
hawthorne that grows north of the mulberry
tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And when I give three caws,&#8221; said
Colonel Claw to the birds in the oak tree,
&#8220;fly swiftly to Temple Garden and alight
on the tall elm tree to the east of the mulberry
tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Tono and Rainbow returned to
Mount Fern, and Colonel Claw to his
perch in the mulberry tree.</p>

<p>Colonel Claw knew all about the birthday
party, for he had heard of it from
the Elves, who in turn had heard Mary
and Anna talking about it.</p>

<p>He knew that after the guests arrived
they were to have supper at the Hall, and
that after supper they were all to come out
to the garden and play games around the
mulberry tree.</p>

<p>The party was at eight o&#8217;clock, and
precisely at eight Colonel Claw gave three
loud caws to the birds in the oak tree,
Tono blew three long blasts on his bugle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and as soon as these signals were given,
the birds and the insects all flew away to
the hawthorne and elm, near the mulberry
tree.</p>

<p>When the elves arrived at Templeton
Hall they heard strains from a giant orchestra,
and the air was rich with the
fragrance of flowers. They entered unobserved,
for an elf has many ways of
making himself invisible, and does not
have to be seen unless he wants to be.</p>

<p>Emily was standing in the middle of
the parlor dressed in fine Persian lawn,
adorned with blue ribbons.</p>

<p>And soon the door-bell rang, and again
and again and again, until all the guests
were assembled. And they each wished
Emily very many happy returns of the
day.</p>

<p>Then Emily led her guests to a large
veranda all covered with roses and clematis,
and there supper was served.</p>

<p>The tables were covered with beautiful
flowers and all kinds of fruit, and turkey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
chicken and tongue, hot rolls and hot biscuits,
and brown bread and butter, after
which came the ice cream and cake.</p>

<p>And <i>such</i> a cake!</p>

<p>It was made in the form of a great big
shoe, and lined with silver paper. Inside
the shoe there were dolls and toys
for every one of the guests, and a great
big doll for Emily&mdash;just like the old
woman who lived in a shoe! And all the
little guests said it was the nicest and
funniest birthday cake they had ever
seen.</p>

<p>And as soon as supper was over Emily
led her guests to the mulberry tree which
stood in the middle of the garden.</p>

<p>Dr. Templeton was prouder of this tree
than of anything else in the garden, for he
believed it to be a great-grandchild of the
mulberry tree which Shakespeare planted
at Stratford so long ago. And whenever
there was company at Templeton Hall,
Dr. Templeton always brought them out
to the garden to show them the mulberry
tree.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>On the evening of Emily&#8217;s birthday it
was hung with Chinese lanterns from the
top to the bottom&mdash;in all the gay colors of
the rainbow. And around this beautiful
tree, Emily and her guests danced and
played games by the light of the lanterns
until the birthday party was over.</p>

<p>But just then a strange thing occurred&mdash;not
strange to the elves, who knew all
about it, but to Emily, her guests, and her
Father and Mother.</p>

<p>For Rainbow, the elf, appeared on the
green and a daintier little gentleman never
was seen. His blue satin coat, with silvery
leaves embroidered in wreaths, his white
silken hose and gilt-buckled shoes, and his
blue Forget-Me-Not girdle, made an exquisite
picture.</p>

<p>With three very low bows he flew
straight to Emily, and told her that the
insect choir would be pleased to favor her
with some music in honor of her birthday.
Then Rainbow made a motion to Tono,
who had charge of the insect choir. Tono<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
gave the word of command, and the fiddlers,
drummers, and pipers of the insect
world appeared.</p>

<p>The short-horned Grasshoppers were
there with their bows and fiddles; the
musical Cicadas were also there with their
high-tuned kettle drums; and the meadow
Grasshoppers were playing: &#8220;Zip, zip,
zee-e-e! Zip, zip, zee-e-e!&#8221;</p>

<p>The pale-green, bashful Katydids, who
are usually heard but not seen, were also
there singing with all their might: &#8220;Katy
did! she did, she did, she didn&#8217;t!&#8221; over
and over again.</p>

<p>And the cheery crickets with their happy
chirpings, sang: &#8220;Cheer-up! cheer-up!
cheer-up!&#8221;</p>

<p>They all sang and played most heartily,
all in honor of Emily&#8217;s birthday. And
when they had finished there was loud
applause and cries of &#8220;More! more!&#8221;</p>

<p>But just at that moment Colonel Claw
stepped forward, and told them that the
birds also would be pleased to favor Emily
and her guests with some music.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>A Starling, whom Colonel Claw had
taught to make a speech for the occasion,
stepped forward and said that as all the
birds in Templeton Garden had been most
kindly treated, and had even had fine, comfortable
houses provided for them, they
wanted to show their appreciation by
helping to celebrate Emily&#8217;s birthday.</p>

<p>Then the Starling, bowing low, turned
to Emily and added: &#8220;In the name of all
the birds of Templeton Garden, I wish
you a great many happy returns!&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying he returned to the elm tree.
Colonel Claw gave the word of command,
and the music began.</p>

<p>The birds are the sweetest of all sweet
singers, and the chorus was grand. It was
a billow of song that rose and fell like the
waves of a mighty ocean. At times no one
voice could be heard distinctly; again, the
flute-like notes of the Wood Thrush, the
Purple Finch&#8217;s rich, melodious warble, or
the beautiful trill of the Vireo could be
heard quite plainly above the chorus.</p>

<p>The birds were jubilant. Never before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
had they sung with so much strength and
sweetness. And when at last the music
died away in gentle cadences, Emily and
her friends clapped their hands in glee,
and said they had never in all their lives
heard anything so beautiful.</p>

<p>Then Tono, at a signal from Captain
Featherweight, bowed low before Emily
and said: &#8220;The elves of Mount Fern take
this opportunity to express their thanks
for their comfortable home in Templeton
Garden, and beg that their choir and orchestra
may be allowed to take part in the
celebration of your birthday.&#8221;</p>

<p>Emily was very much delighted and
said that any one was fortunate who had
the elves for friends.</p>

<p>So the elfin choir and orchestra flew up
into the large white oak tree that stood
near the mulberry tree. And there they
played and sang the music which Rhymo
and Tono had composed for the occasion:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>The Wish of the Elves.</i></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;&#8217;Tis a festive occasion</div>
<div class="indent">Which brings us today,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; To sing thy high praises</div>
<div class="indent">In musical lay!</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Your life in its morning</div>
<div class="indent">Dawns glorious and bright,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; With promise of sunshine,</div>
<div class="indent">And gladness and light.</div>

<div class="indent">The gifts most sublime,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Great courage and wisdom,</div>
<div class="indent">And hope for all time!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Emily knew she had never heard anything
half so wonderful. She told her
Father and Mother that this was the
most splendid day she had ever lived, and
that she did not know how she was ever
going to wait until her next birthday&mdash;for
she thought birthdays were the very nicest
days in all the year.</p>

<p>Just as she said this, she saw Captain
Featherweight and Rhymo coming toward
her. The Captain carried a box, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
wondered if she were really going to get
another present after all she had already
received.</p>

<p>Rhymo began to speak, and he recited
the verse he had made for the necklace:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;The Elves of Mount Fern</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Are so glad to discern</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; When a young girl is kind, good and wise,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; That they&#8217;re prone to reward,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; When her birthday comes round,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; With a gift that will gladden her eyes.</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Accept then this necklace of gold,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; And the wish that you&#8217;ll never grow old</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; In faith, hope and charity,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Truth in its rarity,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Goodness and kindness untold.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Then Captain Featherweight took the
necklace of fine filigree gold and placed it
around Emily&#8217;s neck.</p>

<p>And Emily felt like a Queen, and she
told her Father and Mother that she was
the happiest girl in all the wide world.</p>

<p>Thus ended the birthday party.</p>

<span class="smcap">The King of the Elves Visits Mount
Fern</span></h2></div>


<p>The next evening, while the elves were
at breakfast, Lightning informed Captain
Featherweight that the King of the Elves
was coming to visit Mount Fern.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is good news,&#8221; said the Captain,
&#8220;are you sure it is true?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite sure,&#8221; said Lightning, &#8220;for I saw
Okla of Oakdale, and he told me that the
King is now visiting Elmsdale; and from
Elmsdale he&#8217;s coming to Oakdale; and
from Oakdale he&#8217;s coming to Mount
Fern.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is really good news!&#8221; said the
Captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what shall we do to entertain
him?&#8221; asked Rainbow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing at all,&#8221; said the Captain, &#8220;for
when the King goes visiting he always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
takes his entertainers with him. He has
his own musicians, his own jesters, and
his own actors.</p>

<p>&#8220;The King does this in his own defence,
for he says it is a King&#8217;s privilege not to
be entertained unless he wants to be. So
we&#8217;ll only have to receive him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I make a poem for him?&#8221; asked
Rhymo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; said the Captain, &#8220;for he
has his own Court poet, who is the best in
the world, and if he wants a poem he has
only to say so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t we have anything extra to do
before he comes?&#8221; asked the flower-elf.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; replied the Captain, &#8220;and
you especially, Iris-Wing, will be very
busy, for the King is most particular
about the care of plants, and if a single
plant is neglected it makes him unhappy.
So I want Templeton Garden to be a
perfect bower of well-kept plants when
the King comes to visit us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I be asked to sing or play?&#8221;
asked Tono.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>&#8220;I should say not,&#8221; replied the Captain,
&#8220;for the King always travels with his own
musicians, and if he wants any music he
has only to say so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how shall we address him?&#8221; asked
Slumber.</p>

<p>&#8220;As &#8216;Noble King,&#8217; &#8216;Your Majesty,&#8217; or
&#8216;Your Royal Highness&#8217;,&#8221; said the Captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;If there is any doubt as to which he
prefers, couldn&#8217;t we address him as &#8216;Your
Royal Majesty&#8217;s Noble Highness&#8217;?&#8221; asked
Touchstone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence!&#8221; commanded Captain Featherweight.
&#8220;This is no time for jesting,
and if any elf from this time forward be
found guilty of jesting about the King,
he shall forthwith be sent to Doomdell.
This time I spare you, Touchstone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I touch stone next time, noble
Captain?&#8221; asked Touchstone.</p>

<p>But as soon as he saw that the Captain
was really angry that he should joke in
this way about the prison walls of Doomdell,
he immediately got down on bended
knee and begged the Captain&#8217;s pardon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
And Captain Featherweight, who was
anxious that they should all live in harmony,
graciously granted it.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Owly,&#8221; continued the Captain, &#8220;I
warn <i>you</i> not to be too clever. I should
think Prince Prigio would be a warning
to you. Don&#8217;t you remember how everybody
hated him because he was so very
clever and let everybody know it? And
that it was only when he concealed the fact
and <i>seemed</i> no cleverer than other people
that they began to love him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my best,&#8221; said Owly, &#8220;but if I
am as clever as you say, it is my nature
to be so and I cannot help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can be clever and tactful, too,&#8221;
said the Captain. &#8220;Take Rainbow for
your model, and learn of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;And if you ask a question of the King,
you must say: &#8216;Your Royal Highness,
may I be permitted to ask&mdash;&mdash;&#8217; and so
forth.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you must <i>not</i> say: &#8216;May I ask&mdash;your
Royal Highness?&#8217; &#8216;Your Royal
Highness&#8217; or &#8216;Your Majesty&#8217; must always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
come before &#8216;I&#8217; or &#8216;me&#8217; when you are addressing
the King.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rainbow, as usual, I put you in charge
of the whole affair. You must instruct the
others in the proper etiquette for the
occasion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I gather countless fireflies for
the illumination?&#8221; asked Lightning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not fireflies, but glowworms,&#8221; said the
Captain. &#8220;They are rarer and will therefore
do the King more honor.</p>

<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;ll send to the Dwarfs of Cavedale,
and have them make a thousand silver
filigree lanterns to hold the glowworms,
and hang from the ceilings of
Mount Fern, and from the branches of
trees near our dwelling.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the floors shall be carpeted with
the petals of roses; and the walls hung
with star-flower and forget-me-not.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the sweetest and freshest of
honeydew must be collected, with the
ripest and most luscious of the fruits, and
the most perfect of the nuts.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now I think this is all I need tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
you, for, as I said before, the King will
manage his own entertainment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right! Left! Shoulder arms!&#8221;</p>

<p>At this command every elf went to
work.</p>

<p>The flower-elf ran off to the mulberry
tree in search of Colonel Claw. He found
him perching on one of the lower branches,
so up he flew and sat beside him. And he
told him all about the expected visit of the
King.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing the King so much dislikes
as an ill-kept garden,&#8221; said the
flower-elf. &#8220;And so I have come to ask
your kind assistance in a battle against
the canker-worms, grubs, beetles, ants and
other insects that eat out the life of the
flowers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my best,&#8221; said Colonel Claw.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll get all the birds in the neighborhood
to wage incessant warfare against all the
enemies of the flowers! And I&#8217;ll begin
this very hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A thousand thanks,&#8221; said Iris-Wing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
&#8220;you have my undying gratitude, and if I
can ever help you, be sure I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the flower-elf bade adieu to
Colonel Claw and went in search of
Slumber.</p>

<p>He found him resting on a bank of
fern-moss, and told him that he wanted
him to make the gardener dream such
dreams as would make that lazy fellow do
the work of his life.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how you are going to do
it,&#8221; said the flower-elf, &#8220;but it will have
to be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave that to me,&#8221; said Slumber, &#8220;for
I am sure I can manage it. Think of the
bluebirds&#8217; feathers and doubt not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust you entirely,&#8221; said the flower-elf,
&#8220;and I know that all will be well.</p>

<p>&#8220;But now I must go and see where the
best honeydew is to be found. And while
I am testing the honeydew I will just make
a note of the nuts and fruits that I happen
to see.&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying he departed waving his hand
in adieu.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>Lightning went to the Dwarfs of Cavedale
and ordered a thousand lanterns of
filigree silver.</p>

<p>Tono trained his choir and orchestra so
that he would be prepared if the King
should ask him to sing or play.</p>

<p>Rhymo made verses all night long, for
he did not want to be caught napping if
the King should ask him for one of his
poems.</p>

<p>Rainbow was carefully planning the details,
and every one came to him for advice.</p>

<p>When the gardener had gone to bed for
the night, Slumber entered his cottage
noiselessly, softly entered his sleeping-room,
and gently beat on the drum of his
ear.</p>

<p>And the gardener dreamed and dreamed.
He thought he was on a desert plain,
and he was very thirsty&mdash;so thirsty that
he did not care for anything in the world
but <i>water</i>. His throat was parched; the
sky was red; the grass was brown; the
sun was scorching!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>And there was not a drop of water in
sight! There were no clouds in the sky
to bring rain, nor a sign of moisture anywhere!</p>

<p>Just as he thought he could stand it no
longer, a frightful hobgoblin with black
wings and piercing eyes came hovering
over him, and cried in a voice of thunder:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re thirsty, are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Thirsty,&#8217;&#8221; sighed the gardener, &#8220;I&#8217;m
dying of thirst!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go first and water the flowers; then
you may drink,&#8221; said the goblin, as he
flew up in the air uttering a horrid shriek.</p>

<p>But the gardener dreamed again: this
time he was starving; and there was not
a scrap of food in sight, not even a grain
of corn to satisfy his gnawing hunger.</p>

<p>And when he thought he could stand it
no longer, the same frightful hobgoblin
came flying toward him, and flapped its
great wings and cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re hungry, are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So hungry that I&#8217;m fainting,&#8221; whispered
the gardener.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>&#8220;Go first and feed your plants, and then
you may eat,&#8221; said the goblin. Then away
he flew and left him alone as before.</p>

<p>But the gardener dreamed still again,
and this time he thought he was in his own
cottage. The walls of the cottage began
to shrink; and the tables and chairs and
everything else in the room began to move
toward him. The windows shut of themselves;
the shades rolled down; the air
grew close and stifling.</p>

<p>And he couldn&#8217;t escape, for just as soon
as he moved one chair away, another one
took its place.</p>

<p>The chairs and tables moved nearer and
nearer; and the gardener was so weary
that he wanted to sink on the floor; but
there was not room, for everything in the
cottage piled itself right up against him
so that he could not move.</p>

<p>The air grew thicker and thicker, and
the night grew blacker and blacker, but
not so black that he could not see the
goblin coming toward him.</p>

<p>And the goblin flew straight to the gardener,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
flapped its heavy wings, and shouted
at him:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re cramped for room, are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m dying,&#8221; said the gardener.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then help the plants to live. Pull up
the weeds, give the plants room, and you
may live yourself,&#8221; said the goblin as he
flew away in the darkness.</p>

<p>At this point the dream-elf, thinking his
work well done, hastened back to Mount
Fern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some dreams,&#8221; said he to himself,
&#8220;are good for a gardener, and I think
this one will be.&#8221;</p>

<p>Very early the next morning the flower-elf
and Slumber went into the garden to
see what was happening there.</p>

<p>And lo and behold! Colonel Claw was
at work with a whole host of birds, destroying
the insects that eat out the life
of the flowers. Such a chattering you
never did hear, for they sang and talked
as they worked.</p>

<p>A host of Warblers was destroying
plant-lice, canker-worms, and caterpillars.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>Catbirds were waging warfare against
grasshoppers, beetles, and other insects.</p>

<p>Swallows were flying hither and thither
in search of insects, and catching their
prey on the wing; and each as he passed a
friend or a brother cried out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry up, there is work to be done!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Flickers were ridding the garden
of ants, and gaily they worked and well.</p>

<p>And Sparrows were eating the seeds of
the weeds, so that none might escape to
grow up and choke out the flowers.</p>

<p>All the birds helped in the work, and
destroyed all the harmful insects and weed
seeds.</p>

<p>And this army of birds had just got to
work when the gardener appeared on the
scene. He came much earlier than usual;
and he fed and watered the plants; and he
weeded and spaded and hoed; and not a
single plant was neglected.</p>

<p>And early each morning Colonel Claw
marshalled his army of birds to do battle
against the plants&#8217; enemies.</p>

<p>And early each morning the gardener,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
too, kept on with his weeding and hoeing.</p>

<p>So that the garden grew and flourished.
The flowers were blooming with happiness,
and they smiled and nodded their
beautiful heads while they said to the
gardener:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear sir, you are kindness itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>And all the elves were delighted, especially
the flower-elf.</p>

<p>Dr. Templeton, too, was delighted, and
he and his wife came oftener than usual
to walk in the garden and admire the beautiful
flowers.</p>

<p>One evening at starlight the Captain received
a message from the King, saying
that before a week would go by he would
visit Mount Fern, for he planned to be
there on Tuesday next at the full of
the moon.</p>

<p>At last the great night arrived, and the
elves were all dressed in oak leaves in
honor of the King (for the oak is the
King&#8217;s favorite tree).</p>

<p>And of course they wore their girdles,
for on a great occasion an elf would no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
more think of going without a girdle, than
a young lady would think of going to a
party without her slippers.</p>

<p>From the entrance to Templeton Garden,
all the way to Mount Fern, the path-way
was strewn with flowers and studded
with arches.</p>

<p>The first arch was made of <i>laurel</i> to
show that the elves honored their King:
the second was made of <i>roses</i> to show
that they loved him: and the third arch
was made of <i>pansies</i> to show that they
always thought of him.</p>

<p>The arches and shrubbery were hung
with silver filigree lanterns, and the
glowworms shone and shed their soft
lights around.</p>

<p>And Lightning, the messenger-elf, who
had been sent out in the evening to watch
for the arrival of the King, returned in
great haste just at midnight to say that
the King was coming&mdash;for the King&#8217;s
herald had blown three blasts on his
bugle to proclaim His Majesty&#8217;s approach.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>Then the Elves of Mount Fern took
their silver trumpets and blew three answering
blasts as a greeting to all the
King&#8217;s company.</p>

<p>Two elves were stationed at each of
the arches, and they bowed down on
bended knee as the King passed by, and
cried: &#8220;All hail, noble King!&#8221;</p>

<p>And when the King and his retinue arrived
at Mount Fern, Captain Featherweight
was there to receive them.</p>

<p>After the greetings were over, Rainbow
and Iris-Wing led the King to a
flower-throne which was made of the softest
and sweetest of pansies.</p>

<p>Then Rainbow took a golden goblet
and bowed down before the King, and
said: &#8220;Noble King, will you drink?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; said the King.</p>

<p>So Rainbow took a pitcher-plant and
poured out some sparkling nectar; and
the King took the goblet and drank and
refreshed himself.</p>

<p>Iris-Wing bowed down before the King
and asked:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>&#8220;Noble King, will you eat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; said the King.</p>

<p>Then Iris-Wing took the freshest and
ripest of nuts, and the most luscious of
fruits, and brought these to the King.
And he ate and enjoyed them.</p>

<p>When the King had partaken of nuts
and berries and nectar, he said to the
Captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Featherweight, I long have
wanted to visit you and your Company,
but duties of state have prevented. I am
delighted with Mount Fern!</p>

<p>&#8220;Your home is a bower; your furnishings
dainty and elegant; and your fare is
delicious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tomorrow we&#8217;ll visit the gardens.
This evening we&#8217;ll spend in quiet conversing,
in puzzles and riddles, conundrums
and puns. I love a good joke when I&#8217;m
tired of affairs of the kingdom.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Featherweight, bowing low,
replied: &#8220;Your Majesty&#8217;s wish is our
pleasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the King, looking up at the ceiling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
was struck by the soft glow of the filigree
lanterns, and asked the Captain what
lighting he used.</p>

<p>Bowing low, the Captain replied: &#8220;The
light of the glowworm.&#8221;</p>

<p>The King was delighted and said that
he himself had never once thought of
glowworms, but had always used firefly
lanterns. Then he called his secretary and
told him to make a note of the lighting of
Mount Fern.</p>

<p>After that he called his musicians and
told them to set the lighting of Mount
Fern to music, and this was the song that
they sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Sparkle, burnished lanterns,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Silver lanterns!</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; What a lot of glowworms,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Great and small;</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; How your lights are shedding</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Forth their radiance,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; Over King and Captain&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; And elves all!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>After the music the King called Iris-Wing
and asked him what flowers he grew
in the garden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Noble King,&#8221; said the flower-elf,
&#8220;there are pansies, narcissi and roses,
rosemary and rue, and daffodils, lilies and
daisies, and violets blue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is well,&#8221; said the King. &#8220;Is that
all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; said the elf.</p>

<p>But just here Touchstone came forward
and bowed down before the King and
said: &#8220;Your Highness, may I be permitted
to speak?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may,&#8221; said the King.</p>

<p>&#8220;Noble King, there are blondes and brunettes
in the garden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! Blondes and brunettes, do you
say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, your Highness,&#8221; said Touchstone
&#8220;the brunette is Black-eyed Susan, and
Blue-eyed Mary&#8217;s the blonde.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! Ha!&#8221; laughed the King. &#8220;I see,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;and what other strange plants
do you grow?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>&#8220;What is seen on the western sky at
sunset,&#8221; answered Touchstone.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what is that?&#8221; asked the King.</p>

<p>&#8220;Golden-Glow,&#8221; said the elf.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is bright,&#8221; remarked the King,
&#8220;and what else do you grow in your garden?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We grow animals, too, in the garden!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What? Animals, too, in the garden!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, your Highness,&#8221; said Touchstone,
&#8220;we grow the Bear-berry, the Tiger-Lily
and the Dande-Lion!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How true!&#8221; laughed the King, &#8220;and
what next?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A knave in church,&#8221; said the jester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very many, I fear,&#8221; the King agreed.
&#8220;But what is yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Jack-in-the-Pulpit,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! Ha!&#8221; laughed the King, &#8220;you&#8217;ve
done well, and now I am most anxious to
examine that wonderful garden of yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will your Majesty go to the garden
<i>now</i>?&#8221; asked the flower-elf.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; said the King.</p>

<p>Then Captain Featherweight and Iris-Wing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
escorted the King all over the garden
and grounds around Templeton Hall.
And the King was delighted, and gave the
Captain and the flower-elf much praise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yours is the best-kept garden I&#8217;ve
seen in my travels,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and as a
reward for your diligence, interest, and
skill, I&#8217;ll give <i>you</i>, Iris-Wing, a girdle of
gold.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now in Elfland a golden girdle is scarcely
ever worn except by the Captain of a
Company. And to be presented with one
was in itself a great honor; but to be presented
with a golden girdle by the <i>King</i>
was a very great honor indeed!</p>

<p>Then the flower-elf bowed low to the
King of the elves, and made answer:
&#8220;Your Highness, you honor me greatly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Arise,&#8221; said the King, &#8220;you are
worthy. I&#8217;ll have the girdle designed by
the Dwarfs of the Court, and you and the
elves of Mount Fern will come there to
receive it one year from today.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they had made a tour of the
flower garden they went into the orchard;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and they found that the woodpeckers, nut-hatches
and creepers had done their work
thoroughly, for there was not a sign of a
caterpillar anywhere, nor the eggs of any
insect.</p>

<p>The lawns too were just as well kept,
for they were all smooth and velvety, and
not a weed could be found.</p>

<p>And the more he examined the grounds,
the more pleased was the King, and he
constantly cried: &#8220;Captain Featherweight,
I am delighted.&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as he had returned to Mount
Fern he said to the Captain: &#8220;Let your
elves be seated around me on the soft
rose-petals so lavishly strewn on the floor,
as a carpet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he told them all how delighted he
was with his visit to Mount Fern; and how
much he enjoyed the birds, the trees and
the flowers in Templeton Garden.</p>

<p>&#8220;And do not forget that a year from
to-night you&#8217;re to come to the Court of the
King of the elves, where the flower-elf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
shall receive a golden girdle for work well
done in the garden.</p>

<p>&#8220;And all the other elves of Mount Fern
shall receive a prize for work well done
in the Company.</p>

<p>&#8220;And&mdash;as this is the best-trained Company
I have seen in my travels&mdash;I shall
give you, Captain Featherweight, an old
and priceless Egyptian amulet worth more
than its weight in rubies.</p>

<p>&#8220;But now I must say good-night, for
tomorrow I&#8217;m off to the woodlands.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the King had retired for the
night, Captain Featherweight made a motion
to Slumber to go to the King of the
elves, and help him dream pleasant
dreams.</p>

<p>Then Slumber sat by his bedside and
helped him to dream this dream:</p>

<p>The King dreamed he sat by a running
river that sparkled and shone in the moonlight,
as it rolled over the stones at the
bottom in ripples of gleaming silver. And
on either side of the flowing river were
the softest, greenest, freshest moss-covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
banks; while at a little distance magnificent
oaks and elms cast their beautiful
shadows beneath. And the birds sang in
the tree-tops and carolled gaily with
health and happiness.</p>

<p>The air was cool and sweet; the flowers
were bright and gay; all nature was glad;
and the King of the elves was happy.</p>

<p>And soon he saw coming toward him
a chariot of roses drawn by thirty-three
humming-birds, three in a row.</p>

<p>The chariot stopped near the King, and
one of the humming-birds bowed and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Noble King, your Empire is all the
world; and we have come to take you over
land and sea; over high mountains, and
rocky billows, to the land of the rising
sun. Arise and sit in our chariot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the King arose and sat in the chariot,
and the birds flew ever onward&mdash;past
snow-clad peaks and tall cathedral spires,
past green fields and rustling corn&mdash;on, on,
on through the bright clear air till they
came to the land of the rising sun.</p>

<p>And as soon as they entered there they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
heard the blowing of trumpets and beating
of drums, and a million voices cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hail, King of the elves! Noble King
of the elves!&#8221;</p>

<p>And the sweetest flowers nodded their
beautiful heads, and welcomed the King
and cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Our noble protector, all hail!&#8221;</p>

<p>The next evening at starlight the King
of the elves set off for the woodlands.
And Captain Featherweight and his Company
escorted him and his retinue far past
the walls of Templeton Garden before
they returned to Mount Fern.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
